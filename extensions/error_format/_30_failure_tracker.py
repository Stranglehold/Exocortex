---
REFLECTION REQUIRED — You have failed to use tool "{tool_name}" {count} consecutive times.

Before attempting any action, answer these questions in your thoughts:
1. What specifically caused the failure? (Be precise — wrong args, wrong tool type, wrong approach?)
2. Are you calling an agent tool as a terminal command? If so, stop. Use JSON tool_name field instead.
3. Are you scoping actions correctly? (Skill work stays in skill directory. Never touch /a0/requirements.txt for skill tasks.)
4. What will you do differently this time?

Only after answering these questions, output your next JSON action.
